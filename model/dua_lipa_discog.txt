[Verse 1]
I see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
I'm not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 2]
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, 'cause you got inside my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Bridge]
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
I could be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Be the one, be the one, be the one
Will you be mine?

[Chorus]
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
'Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one

[Verse 1]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?

[Chorus 1]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?

[Verse 2]
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This Garden of Eden?
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Verse 3]
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?

[Chorus 2]
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Bridge]
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?

[Chorus 3]
So are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Are we leaving?
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)
This garden of Eden
(Eden, Eden, Eden)

[Intro: Take A Daytrip]
(Hey!)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Verse 2]
I dedicate this verse to (Verse to)
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah (Oh)
You always let me down, boy (Oh, oh)
But when you're going down, I get so up (So up)
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist (Ah-ha)

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Oh-oh)
We drive each other mad (Oh-oh)
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what)

[Bridge]
(Ah)
Yeah, we don't know how to talk (Mmm)
But damn, we know how to fuck

[Chorus]
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad (Ah)
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head (Messing with my head)
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please (Oh, please), come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us good in bed)

[Post-Chorus]
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed (That's what makes us)
It's bad (Mmm)
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed

[Intro]
Ah yeah
Ah yeah

[Verse 1]
He calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Verse 2]
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can’t let me know I'm wanted
Can’t let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I’m coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

[Bridge]
Oh, you're down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
'Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you take me right there
We could make it

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
And you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
And I'll give it to you

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Here, where the sky's falling
I'm covered in blue
I'm running and I'm crawling
Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
There's a crack in my window
A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water
All my dreams have come true
Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]
You give me a reason, something to believe in
I know, I know, I know
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in
I know, I know, I know
It's a bittersweet feeling
Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true
That I wish I was there with you
That I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

[Verse 1]
Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 2]
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

[Refrain]
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Bridge]
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe

[Chorus]
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here

[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here

[Outro]
Hmm
Oh-oh-oh here, here
Hmm
Here, here
Are we over here?

[Verse 1]
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Verse 2]
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Pre-Chorus]
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

[Bridge]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
Oh, goddamn, you got me in love again
(We're in love, we're in love)
(We're in love, we're in love, oh, oh)

[Refrain]
I can't believe, I can't believe
I finally found someone
I'll sink my teeth in disbelief
'Cause you're the one that I want
I can't believe there's something left inside my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again

[Chorus]
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again (Again and again)
Again (And again and again and again)

[Verse 1]
I'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 2]
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah

[Chorus]
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to

[Post-Chorus]
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Bridge]
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to

[Outro]
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body

[Verse 1]
Know you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

[Chorus]
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah

[Verse 2]
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care

[Verse 1]
Met a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Verse 2]
Another thing that he told me
"It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase

[Pre-Chorus]
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"

[Chorus]
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly

[Bridge]
No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh

[Chorus]
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon

[Verse 1]
All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Verse 2]
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given

[Pre-Chorus]
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

[Bridge]
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Funny, you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving

[Chorus]
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, I want you to stay
I want you to stay, I want you to stay

Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse]
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Verse 2]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass

[Bridge]
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

[Refrain]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes

[Chorus]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses, I miss my cocoa butter kisses, yeah

[Verse 1]
Fatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 2]
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette

[Pre-Chorus]
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone

[Chorus]
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Bridge]
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?

[Breakdown]
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

[Verse 1]
I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 2]
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?

[Pre-Chorus]
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Bridge]
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily, tread

[Chorus]
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
This is not a, this is not a
Swan (Tread heavily), swan song (Tread)
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight (Tread heavily)
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
I bet we’re higher than the people on cloud nine
This connection got me feeling like
I’ve known you my whole life, wow
Even our shadows know each other in the light
So I do, I think of loosing you
And you’re right by my side, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
I’m not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that’s what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the flow in my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can’t explain
Wicked love's creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
So baby don’t you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain’t me
And baby if you ever (uh-uh)
Find another lover, you see
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain’t me

[Verse 2: Normani]
I got a little devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, wow
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it’s goodbye, huh

[Pre-Chorus: Normani]
I’m not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that’s what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the flow in my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can’t explain
Wicked love's creeping up

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Normani]
So baby don’t you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain’t me
And baby if you ever (uh-uh)
Find another lover, you see
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain’t me

[Hook: Dua Lipa]
So baby don’t you let go
I’m not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that’s what I feel
Like what if you left me here
Like what if you left me here
And I feel the flow in my sequin tears

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Normani, Normani]
So baby don’t you let go (uh-uh)
The thought of you with someone kills me
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke (Heart broke)
Such a sad disco (disco), if it ain’t me
And baby if you ever (uh-uh, Ever)
Find another lover (Find another), you see
I’ll be dancing with my heart broke (Heart broke)
Such a sad disco (disco), if it ain’t me

[Verse 1]
What are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
(I wanna be) yours
(I wanna, wanna be) yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
Eh

[Pre-Chorus]
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours (ooh-hoo)
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours

I wanna be fine
I wanna be that favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

I wanna be yours (hey)
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of

Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you

And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I'd do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet

You give me a feeling, feeling so strong

[Verse 1]
Something told me it was [?]
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul starts crying out
When I saw you and that girl walking around

[Chorus]
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me, child, no

[Chorus]
I was just, I was just, I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
And the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now, baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face

[Chorus]
And, baby, baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
Baby, baby, I would rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me

Something told me it was [?]
When I saw you and her talking

[Intro]
If you don't wanna see me

[Verse 1]
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
(Don't, don't, don't)

[Chorus]
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now ('Bout me now, 'bout me)

Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now (Oh)

[Verse 1]
In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 2]
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Bridge]
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising

[Chorus]
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

[Verse 1]
What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
Got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Verse 2]
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you

[Pre-Chorus]
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh

[Bridge]
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

[Chorus]
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning

[Verse 1]
You don't know what you've lost 'til it's gone
You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Bridge]
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

[Chorus]
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak

I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

I was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight

[Chorus 1]
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down

[Verse 2]
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"

Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down

Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie

Last night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know, know, know, know

Inside I'm screaming loud, I'm calling out your name
It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey

Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go

No, I ain't got no money, but I'm letting you know

Body make you silly, make you do what I want
Oh baby, I can make it pretty, I could string you along

[Bridge]
Wanna be right where you are
Let's go dancing in the dark
Don't wait, you can push to start, lose control
Kill me slowly with your kiss
Wrap me 'round your fingertips
Damn, I need another hit
(Make me lose my mind)

[Chorus]
I hallucinate when you call my name
Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I'm losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind

[Verse 1]
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating
You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)
I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating

[Verse 2]
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars

[Pre-Chorus]
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You, moonlight, you're my starlight (You're the moonlight)

You can fly away with me tonight
You can fly away with me tonight

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

My love is like a rocket, watch it blast off
And I'm feeling so electric, dance my ass off
And even if I wanted to, I can't stop

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 2]
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Bridge]
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?

[Chorus]
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you

[Verse 1]
Gotta get something off of my chest, can I get a witness?
Yeah, I got tattoos all on my skin, but scared of commitment
And I keep saying that I love you, I wish you would listen
I wish you would listen
But there's something missin', mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna have to choose between you or having my freedom
Baby, I don't wanna let go of us or what I believe in
I don't wanna feel like I need to leave, don't give me a reason
Don't give me a reason
You know that I mean it, mh

[Pre-Chorus]
You want it all, all my love
I give you some, it's not enough
Am I being selfish?
Baby, I feel helpless
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
No, I ain't into breakin' hearts
But I'm scared of tomorrow
Can I just be selfish?
Can I just be selfish?

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely, oh oh yeah (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

[Bridge]
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
(Just one thing that's on my mind)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(Yeah, if I lose myself)
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)

[Breakdown]
Ahh, if I lose myself
Ahh, yeah
If I give a little more of me
Would I lose myself completely?
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus]
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely (if I lose myself)

Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind

Can I live my life if I give you mine?

Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
(If I lose myself)
If I give a little more of me

[Verse 1]
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 2]
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

[Chorus]
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh

[Verse 2]
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

[Post-Chorus]
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes (no goodbyes)
No goodbyes, eh

[Bridge]
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay

[Chorus]
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)

No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes

[Verse 1]
You, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Verse 2]
Boom, barrel, love, a gun, pow
I'll be on the run now
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Check it with a flashlight
It's the last night you'll get up on it
If you wanna save it, ooh
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh
I ain't waiting for you, you

Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive

Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

[Bridge]
So watch it blow when I let it go
When I cut this rope and run, run
By the time you wake, it'll be too late
Now the bullet's left the gun, yeah

[Chorus]
Now I'm running for my life
Been too many miles
Tryna find the road to you
'Cause you, you just wanna drive
With no place in mind
Where the hell we going to, oh?
I'm running, running
Got me running, running, ooh

Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

[Chorus]
All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)

Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on
Let's get physical

Adrenaline keeps on rushing in
Love the simulation we're dreaming in
Don't you agree?
Don't you agree?
I don't wanna live another life
'Cause this one's pretty nice
Living it up

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

Baby you should leave this girl alone
But you won't, won’t, won't
But you don't, don’t, don't
Now delete my number from your phone
But you won't-won't-won't
You gotta go, go, go
Oh my, my, my
Gonna spell it right out

[Chorus]
I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it’s me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe
I don’t feel how you feel
I'm just telling it like it is
I don’t need you to say those words over
I'm just telling it like it is

Boy, man up
You're not some animal
No no no, no no no
Rather die a thousand times tonight
Than take you home, than take you home
These walls I build, they're never coming down

I don’t know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all

I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is
I'm not messed up baby, I'm not heartless
Just not ready to start looking for apartments
I'm into shopping but no baby departments
Bang, I tell it like it is, I tell it like it is

[Chorus]
Cause I don't know what you're looking for
But I don't think it's me
I wish I could give you my all
Not good at make believe

I look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing

Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something

[Chorus]
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears

Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you

[Verse 1]
What would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 2]
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Bridge]
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together

[Chorus]
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayers

[Verse 1]
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done

[Pre-Chorus]
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Bridge]
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

[Breakdown]
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

[Chorus]
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
(Too late now)
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

[Post-Chorus]
I see you tryna get to me

One, one, one, one, one

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

[Refrain]
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

[Pre-Chorus]
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
(Nowhere to turn, no way)
(Nowhere to turn, no)
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em

I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em

Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over him

[Verse 1]
If you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Verse 2]
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

[Bridge]
When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?

[Chorus]
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah (Gonna break, gonna break)

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension

Trickle down my spine

Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Break]

All of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want

Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away

[Chorus]
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever

'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love

Say you're gonna stay forever

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night

Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe

One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

[Verse 1]
See, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go

[Verse 2]
I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and niggas
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

[Post-Chorus]
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

[Verse 3]
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh

[Chorus]
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up

Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

[Verse 1]
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Verse 2]
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me

[Pre-Chorus]
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Bridge]
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh, break my heart
Ooh
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

[Chorus]
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I–)
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no (Oh no), I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

I keep dancing here with my eyes closed
Like nothing matters anymore

And I like that, kinda like that

Make it hard to talk and see
I'm just where I wanna be
Holding you too close to me
You never leave my glass empty
Ooooh, we got nothing
Ooooh, and that's all we wanted
Broken people in the streets
Yet they’re beautiful to see
Everything is incomplete
Yeah, it feels a lot like me
Ooooh, we got nothing
